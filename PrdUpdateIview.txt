⏺ I'll start by locating and reading the PRD in this project directory.

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/{PRD,prd,SPEC,spec,requirements}*.md")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/*.md")
  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Found it. Let me read the PRD.

⏺ Read(Angle Finder PRD.md)

⏺ Excellent! I've reviewed the PRD for the Stefan Georgi Angle Finder tool. This is a creative tool for generating DTC ad angles through content research and "translocation" of ideas. Let me start the interview to uncover gaps and clarify requirements.
                                                                       
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · What tech stack do you want to use for this tool? → What do you 
     recommend?
     · How should users authenticate? → No Auth Required
     · Where should this tool be deployed/hosted? → Vercel

⏺ Good context. For a tool like this with AI-heavy processing and API integrations, I'd recommend Next.js Full-Stack - it handles the React UI nicely, the API routes can manage your YouTube/Reddit/PubMed calls, and it deploys seamlessly to Vercel. Let me continue probing on the more complex aspects.
                                                                         
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · What AI/LLM should power the analysis and hook generation? → Claude 
     API with Opus 4.5
     · How should long content (1hr+ podcasts) be handled for analysis? → 
     Full transcription + chunked analysis

     · The PRD mentions Whisper for transcription. Where should 
     transcription run? → YouTube captions first, Whisper fallback

⏺ Smart choices - Claude Opus 4.5 is excellent for creative marketing analysis, and the YouTube captions-first approach will save significant processing time and cost. Let me dig into the source discovery mechanics.
                                                                         
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · For YouTube/Podcast search, how should the tool discover content? 
     yt-dlp can download but needs URLs or search queries. → AI generates 
     search queries

     · When a user analyzes multiple sources (e.g., 5 videos), how should 
     results be generated? → Parallel processing

     · How many Claims and Hooks should be generated per source? → 3-5 each
      per source

⏺ Now let me explore some edge cases and UX considerations that could significantly impact implementation.
                                                                         
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · What should happen when a source can't be accessed (video deleted, 
     podcast unavailable, Reddit post removed)? → Skip and notify user

     · Analysis could take 2-5+ minutes for multiple long videos. How 
     should progress be communicated? → Detailed step-by-step progress
     · The PRD mentions saving sessions to a sidebar History. How long 
     should history be retained? → Indefinitely (localStorage)

⏺ Good. Now let me probe some business logic and content quality concerns.
                                                                         
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Should the tool filter out potentially problematic claims 
     (unverified health claims, FTC-risky statements)? → No filtering
     · PubMed returns academic papers. How should scientific content be 
     handled differently than podcasts/YouTube? → Translate to layman 
     terms, Full paper analysis, Link to source + simplified summary
     · Should there be any rate limiting or usage caps (even without auth)?
      → No limits

⏺ Now let me explore the Source Categories more deeply - the PRD gives examples for Health & Supplements but mentions each niche should have unique categories.
                                                                         
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Should I generate the full Source Category lists for all 11 niches, 
     or do you have existing lists you want to use? → Generate all 
     categories
     · The PRD shows 9 categories per strategy. Is this the right number, 
     or should there be more/fewer options? → 12-15 categories

     · When users add custom categories, should these be private or shared 
     with the community? → Private only

⏺ Let me dig into some UI/UX specifics and edge cases.
                                                                         
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · After the 20 sources are displayed, users select which to analyze. 
     What if they want to see MORE sources before selecting? → Load More 
     button

     · For the Claims and Hooks results view, how should users 
     organize/filter the output? → Full sorting and filtering 
     capaibilities, in addition to tags on Claims/Hooks, e.g. Total: X, 
     Source: Pubmed, etc
     · Should users be able to regenerate/refine individual hooks they 
     like? → Yes, Generate Variation button with textarea so useres can 
     input feedback and generate a variation of the hoo

⏺ Excellent - the variation generation with user feedback is a great feature. Let me explore a few more important implementation details.
                                                                         
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · The Reddit API credentials are in the PRD. Should these be stored 
     server-side (secure) or client-side (visible in network tab)? → 
     Server-side only (Recommended)
     · What's the mobile experience expectation? → Fully responsive
     · Should there be a 'Quick Start' mode for users who just want to 
     paste a single YouTube URL and get hooks? → No - keep the full flow

⏺ Good security choice. Let me ask about some edge cases around the "translocation" concept and output quality.
                                                                         
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · For Translocate mode, how 'distant' should the AI go when making 
     bridges? The quantum physics → testosterone example is quite a leap. →
      Should be a range - some aggressive, some moderate, some 
     conservative. Please also include if Bridge is 
     Aggressive/Moderate/Conservative.

     · Should the tool provide guidance on which Angle Types work best for 
     different products/niches? → No - let users discover
     · What happens if the AI can't find enough surprising claims in a 
     source (e.g., generic motivational video)? → Try harder - find 
     something

⏺ Great - the bridge distance range is a smart approach. Let me ask about a few remaining technical and UX concerns.
                                                                         
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · For Reddit source analysis, what should be analyzed - just the 
     original post, or comments too? → Post + top 20 comments
     · The export format is MD (Markdown). Should there be additional 
     export options? → MD only is fine
     · Should users be able to favorite/star specific Claims or Hooks for 
     quick reference later? → Yes - star button on each item

                                                                         
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · What visual design direction should the UI take? → Match CA Pro 
     branding
     · Should there be any onboarding or tutorial for first-time users? → 
     None - interface should be self-explanatory

     · Any specific error messaging tone preference? → Direct/professional


⏺ Let me ask a couple final questions to wrap up the interview.
                                                                         
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Is there anything in Stefan's 'Breakthrough Ideas' training or 
     methodology that should be explicitly referenced in the UI or prompts?
      → Yes, here is more context on specific concepts to incorporate. 
     Don't need to include in UI but should include relevant context from 
     our PRD and this added context to our prompts to get the best copy for
      Hooks/Claims we can possibly get: '''Big Idea Criteria

       A "Big Idea" isn't just a good idea — it's the central, compelling 
     concept that makes your entire ad work. Criteria:

       1. Emotionally Compelling
       Hits a deep desire or fear. Not intellectual — visceral.

       2. Contains Built-In Intrigue
       Creates an open loop. The reader needs to know more.

       3. Easily Understood
       Can be grasped in seconds. If you need to explain it, it's not big 
     enough.

       4. Believable (but surprising)
       Novel enough to be interesting, credible enough to not get 
     dismissed.

       5. Difficult to Steal
       Tied to your specific product/mechanism. Competitors can't just copy
      the headline.

       ---
       Mechanism-First Copywriting

       The "mechanism" is the why it works — the specific process, 
     ingredient, method, or system that makes your product deliver results.

       Why it matters:
       - Claims are commoditized ("lose weight fast")
       - Mechanisms are differentiators ("the 3-second lymphatic flip that 
     unlocks fat cells")

       Structure:
       1. Identify the core mechanism (real or named)
       2. Make it the star of your copy
       3. Tie all claims back to the mechanism
       4. The mechanism answers "why is YOUR solution different?"

       Example:
       - Weak: "This supplement burns fat"
       - Mechanism-first: "The Ethiopian Yellow Root that reactivates your 
     body's dormant brown fat cells"

       ---
       Big Idea Categories

       1. Hidden Cause — There's a secret reason behind your problem
       2. Emerging Opportunity — New discovery/timing makes this possible 
     now
       3. David vs Goliath — Small/underdog solution beats the 
     establishment
       4. Contrarian/Paradigm Shift — Everything you've been told is wrong
       5. Crystal Ball — Prediction-based, what's coming
     '''







     · What's the timeline expectation for the MVP? → Full-featured launch

     · Any additional features or considerations I haven't asked about? → 
     No - good coverage


⏺ This is excellent context on Stefan's methodology. The Big Idea Criteria and Mechanism-First frameworks should absolutely be baked into the prompts. Let me now update the PRD with all the decisions from this interview.

            staggering. What if everything you knew about when to take yo
           ur vitamins was completely backwards? Here's why taking supple

      306 +3. **Easily Understood** - Can be grasped in seconds. If you n

      307 +4. **Believable (but surprising)** - Novel enough to be intere
